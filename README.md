# Introduction to GLM/GLMM's (for scared ecologists) workshop

This repository hosts the `R` scripts and slide decks associated with a 2-day workshop delivered to a number of post-graduate students and staff members at the Center for Biological Control at Rhodes University and Citrus Research International staff members in South Africa. The workshop was intended for ecologists who have little to no experience with `R`.

The data used for some of the case-studies and scripts are NOT hosted on the GitHub repo as they are private, and cannot be hosted permanently. The data will be emailed to all participants, and they need to store the data in the `/data_raw/` folder for all the scripts to work properly.
