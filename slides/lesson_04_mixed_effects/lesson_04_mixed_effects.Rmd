# Mixed effects model (GLMM's)

- In recent years, mixed effects models have become very popular<sup>1<sup>.

--

  - GLMM's extend GLM's by combining fixed effects (from GLM's) with random effects (from GLMM's). 


.footnote[
[1] Bolker et al. 2009 *Trends in Ecology and Evolution*. 
]

---

# What is a random effect? 

--

- Essentially a 'grouping variable'

--

- A variable that describes/accounts for some nesting/grouping structure in your data.

--
    - E.g. Sampling multiple transects within the same experimental plot

--
    - E.g. Sampling multiple quadrats within each transect within the same experimental plot.
    
--

- Or, a variable that you don't really care about, but need to account for to address data independence. 

--

  - E.g. Measurements taken from a variety of sites, but not interested in site-level effects. 

--

# An example 

- Let's consider the following study: 

--

- A test of Harrison's rule: parasite body size is positively correlated with the size of its host. 

--

  - So, we measure the length of n = 20 wasps each taken from their own plant stem (which we measure the diameter of) at each of 5 sites (n = 100 wasps in total). I.e. We take 20 insect body length and 20 plant stem diameter measures per site. 
  
--

  - We don't really care about whether 'site' has an effect on wasp body length, but, there will almost certainly be variance in body length between sites.

--

  - We must account for site-level variance before we estimate the relationship between insect body length and the diameter of the host plant stem.

# How do we fit this model? 

### Option #1:

`mod1 <- glm(insect_body_length ~ plant_stem_diameter, data = df)` 

--

- Nope. We haven't accounted for any between-site variation.

--

- We may incorrectly attribute any site-level variance to an effect of plant stem diameter. 

--

- We could find statistical support for Harrison's rule, when it isn't true. 

---

# How do we fit this model? 

### Option #2:

`mod2 <- glm(insect_body_length ~ plant_stem_diameter + site, data = df)` 

--

- Also a nope. While we have accounted for any between-site variation, we are testing a very different hypothesis to the hypothesis we wanted to test. 

--

- Here, we are testing if (1) plant stem diameter effects insect body length, and (2) whether insect body length differs between sites.

--

*Isn't (1) what we wanted?* 

--

- No. Because we are estimating a much more complex model, we decrease the statistical power of our model. 

--

- We may incorrectly conclude that there is no effect of plant stem diameter on insect body length (i.e. Harrison's rule), when there actually is an effect. 

---

# We need a GLMM

- Here, we take multiple measurements from the same statistical unit (site), which may be more similar than measurements from other sites. 

--

  - This variation **MAY NOT** be random. 

--

  - This is also pseudoreplication. 

--

  - We must use a random effect to explicitly control for the non-independence between data points from within each site, and then estimate the effect of plant stem diameter on insect body length (i.e. Harrison's rule). 

---

# Random intercept 

- We have three options when specifying our random effect. 

--

  - Option #1: Random intercept 

--

  - Option #2: Random slope

--

  - Option #3: Random intercept & random slope

---

### Option #1: Random intercept 


- Allows for the baseline relationship to be higher or lower for each site.   

--

  - Shifts the line up or down the y-axis.
  
--

  - But, the slope of the relationship is consistent across sites. 
  
--

  - We specify a random intercept using the syntax: `(1 | random effect)` 

--

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.height="80%", out.width="80%"}
# Null model 
m0 <- glm(insect_body_length ~ plant_stem_diameter, data=df)
df$simple.model <- predict(m0)

# Model with varying intercept
m1 <- lmer(insect_body_length ~ plant_stem_diameter + (1|site), data = df)
df$random.intercept.preds <- predict(m1)

# Make plot 
df %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = plant_stem_diameter,
                       y = random.intercept.preds,
                       colour = site)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_line(data = df, aes(x = plant_stem_diameter,
                           y = simple.model),
            linetype = "dashed",
            colour = "black") +
  labs(x = "Stem diameter (cm)",
       y = "Insect body length (mm)",
       colour = "Site",
       title = "(a) insect_body_length ~ plant_stem_diameter + (1|site)")
```

---

### Option #2: Random slope


- Allows the fixed effect relationship (i.e. `plant_stem_diameter`) to vary between random effect levels (i.e. `site`).

--

  - The slope of the relationship varies across sites, but the baseline relationship is consistent between sites. 
  
--

  - We specify a random slope using the syntax: `0 + fixed_effect|random effect)` 

--

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.height="80%", out.width="80%"}
# Model with varying slope
m2 <- lmer(insect_body_length ~ plant_stem_diameter + (1 + plant_stem_diameter|site), 
           data=df)
df$random.slope.preds <- predict(m2)

# Make plot 
df %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = plant_stem_diameter,
                       y = random.slope.preds,
                       colour = site)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_line(data = df, aes(x = plant_stem_diameter,
                           y = simple.model),
            linetype = "dashed",
            colour = "black") +
  labs(x = "Stem diameter (cm)",
       y = "Insect body length (mm)",
       colour = "Site",
       title = "(b) insect_body_length ~ plant_stem_diameter + (0 + plant_stem_diameter|site)")
```

---

### Option #3: Random intercept & random slope

--

- Allows the fixed effect relationship (i.e. `plant_stem_diameter`) to vary between random effect levels (i.e. `site`), and allows for the baseline relationship to be higher or lower for each site. 

--

  - We specify a random intercept and random slope using the syntax: `1 + fixed_effect|random effect)` 

--

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.height="80%", out.width="80%"}
# Model with varying slope
m3 <- lmer(insect_body_length ~ plant_stem_diameter + (1 + plant_stem_diameter|site), 
           data=df)
df$random.slope.int.preds <- predict(m2)

# Make plot 
df %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = plant_stem_diameter,
                       y = random.slope.int.preds,
                       colour = site)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_line(data = df, aes(x = plant_stem_diameter,
                           y = simple.model),
            linetype = "dashed",
            colour = "black") +
  labs(x = "Stem diameter (cm)",
       y = "Insect body length (mm)",
       colour = "Site",
       title = "(c) insect_body_length ~ plant_stem_diameter + (1 + plant_stem_diameter|site)")
```

# Let's fit some models in R 

... 

---

# GLMM's - final thoughts

- Random effects are always categorical variables, not numeric. 

--

- Random effects should have at least 5 levels.

--

  - E.g. Sex (male/female) cannot be specified as a random effect. 

--

### Terminology:

--

- *Linear mixed effects model (LMM)*: Model with random effects, where the distribution = gaussian. 

--

  - Specified using the `lme4::lmer` function in R. 

--

- *Generalised linear mixed effects model (GLMM)*: Model with random effects, where the distribution is not = gaussian (e.g. Poisson, Negative binomial, Binomial.)

--

  - Specified using the `lme4::glmer` function in R. 

---

# GLMM's - final thoughts, part 2

- GLMM's are extremely powerful tools, but must be used with caution<sup>2<sup>: 

--

- Rigorous evaluation of model fits (model diagnostics) is vital (e.g. using the `DHARMa` package in `R`).

--

- Experimental design, experimental design, experimental design...

--

  - Proper design of experiments is vital. 

--

  - Identify the hierachical structure of your data to specifcy random effects correctly.
  
--

- My unsolicited advice: 

--

  - Try to write the `R` code for the model you will fit to the new experiment that you want to run (and run it past a friend)
  - If you can't formulate the code for the model, you probably need to rethink the experiment (or find a new `R` tutor!!!).

# GLMM's - final thoughts, part 3

- CONSULT A STATISTICIAN!!!

--

  - NB for GLMM's - they are hard!!!
  
--

  - Don't just consult the statistician *after* the experiment:
